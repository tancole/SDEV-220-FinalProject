# SDEV-220-FinalProject
Final project for SDEV220
Flash Card Application
Authors are Tanner Cole, Lamarna Diallo, & Roan Campbell

Our clients would be school systems, such as Ivy Tech, which are focused on academia and learning. 
We would like to develop a Python-based digital flashcard system. 
Through a graphical user interface, students and instructors would be able to enter card information. 
This information will be logged for retrieval and each flash card will be logged once the user has completed logging it. 
The system will then pull a random card and allow the user to flip the card showing the answer at any time. A
fter the card has been flipped, the user will indicate whether they are correct or incorrect. 
If incorrect, the card can be pulled again from the list. 
If correct, the card will be moved into a new list, thereby removing it from the active question list. 
A reset button will allow the user to reset the active question list. 
The exit button will terminate the program, allowing the user to enter new questions. 
Through this system, students are provided with a convenient way to practice coursework for homework, 
quizzes, and tests while saving space. Furthermore, this system is designed to be affordable and low-cost, 
which allows instructors and academic systems alike to provide their students with an increased amount of learning resources.
